 ### 📌🔨 Task
    Add the following features to the Google Keep clone built in the previous tutorial:

    - You need to design all the assignments you have solved so far using CSS.
    - Apply your knowledge of CSS syntax, selectors, box model, layout, typography, colors, and backgrounds to the design.
    - Use at least two different fonts and two different colors to create a visually appealing design.
    - You should also use one background gradient to add depth and texture to your design.
    - Feel free to use other CSS properties you have learned to enhance the design and make it unique

    Don’t worry about responsive design, we will implement responsive design after learning flexbox and grid.**
