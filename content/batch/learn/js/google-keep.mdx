 ### 📌🔨 Task
    Add the following features to the Google Keep clone built in the previous tutorial:

    - 1. Delete Notes: When a note is deleted, it should be moved to a separate section where all deleted notes can be viewed.
    - 2. Archive Notes: When a note is archived, it should be moved to a separate section where all archived notes can be viewed.
    - 3. Edit Note: Add the ability to edit notes after they have been created.
    - 4. **(Optional)** Reminder: Add a reminder functionality to the notes. Each note should have a due date/time property and when the due date/time is reached, a notification should be displayed.
    - 5. **(Optional)** Sorting Filter: Add the ability to sort and filter notes based on their creation time, reminder time, and other properties.
    - 6. Deploy your first fully working frontend project on GitHub and host it. Share the project's link on LinkedIn and Twitter using the hashtag **#FrontendWithVishal** to showcase your skills and connect with the community.
    - 7. Working Demo [Link](https://notes-puce-seven.vercel.app/)
