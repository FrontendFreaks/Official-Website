 ### 📌🔨 Task

   #### Task 1
    - Add a reset button that resets the counter back to zero
    - Add a feature that allows the user to increment/decrement the counter by a custom value (e.g., 5 or 10)
    - Add a feature that allows the user to change the color of the counter based on its value (e.g., green for positive values, red for negative values).
    - Design your first app, and share the code sandbox link in google sheet for tracking your progress.
    - Working Demo [Link](https://rakesh-indupuri.github.io/Counter-app/) 
    🚀 Don't forget to share your learning and assignments on LinkedIn and Twitter using #FrontendWithVishal to showcase your skills to potential employers!

    #### Task 2
    - Let's head over to the official documentation of ReactJS and read the Describing the UI section in its entirety. We covered these topics in the previous video, but developing the habit of reading documentation is essential to becoming a skilled developer. 📖🤓 Start from Your First Component https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component
    - At the end of each article, you'll find a few challenges to tackle. These challenges will help solidify your understanding of the concepts and make it easier to remember the code syntax. There are a total of 22 challenges spread across 8 articles (start From Your First Component to Keeping Components Pure ). 🧐💻
    - How do you feel after completing these challenges? Did reading the official ReactJS documentation make it easier to understand the technology? Share your experiences and learning journey on LinkedIn and Twitter using the hashtag #FrontendWithVishal to inspire others to learn from the official documentation too. 🤝🚀
