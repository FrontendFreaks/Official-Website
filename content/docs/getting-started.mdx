Here you should find everything you need from getting started with creating content.

</Callout>

## Understanding the folder structure

For writing you may primarly be working on `./content` folder. The `course/index.mdx` files give the structure for [docs](https://courseify-omega.vercel.app/docs) page.

- `/content/js` - Specify js course

<Callout type="warning">
  Naming convention is upto to you just make sure there are no spaces between
  name
</Callout>

The example of Javascript course which has `4 pages`.

```mdx
content/js/
├── index.mdx - the intro page
├── basic.mdx
├── intermediate.mdx
└── advance.mdx
```

If you want to create a course let's say `css` you can add a new folder to `./content`, For example

```mdx
content/css/
├── index.mdx - the intro page
├── page1.mdx
├── page2.mdx
└── page3.mdx
```

<Callout type="info">
  There is no limit to number of pages, so write as much you want
</Callout>

### Add Content to `.MDX` files

Add content Using React components in Markdown using MDX.

```mdx

        Write anything to want using the MDX components
```

<Callout type="danger">
  Make sure to add a title and description to `.mdx files` either they won't
  work
</Callout>

### Update the links in `.config/docs.ts`

As the content is generated now the only remaining part is to show it

- Go to `.config/course.ts`
- Add the links to Newly generated content

```mdx
...
sidebarNav: [
{
title: "Css",
items: [
{
title: "Introduction",
href: "/courses/css",
},
{
title: "topic",
href: "/courses/css/topic-name",
}
...
],
},
```

<Callout type="danger">
  The above code to work Make sure you have `index.mdx` and `topic-name.mdx` in
  `./content/css/`.
</Callout>

- Links without `topic name` go to `index.mdx` in that folder
- `courses/css` reffer to `.content/css/index.mdx`
- `courses/css/topic-name` reffers to `.content/css/topic-name.mdx`
