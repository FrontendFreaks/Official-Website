Here you should find everything you need from getting started with creating content.

</Callout>

## Understanding the folder structure

For writing you may primarly be working on `./content` folder. The `batch/index.mdx` files give the structure for [docs](https://frontend-freaks-website.vercel.app/batch) page.

- `/batch/learn` - Specify learn batch

<Callout type="warning">
  Naming convention is upto to you just make sure there are no spaces between
  name
</Callout>

The example of learn batch which has `4 pages` and each has some more pages.

```mdx
batch/learn/
├── index.mdx - the intro page
├── html - folder
├── github - folder
├── css - folder
└── js - folder
```

If you want to add new page to learn css page let's say `layouts` you can add a new folder to `./content/learn/css`, For example

```mdx
batch/learn/css/
├── index.mdx - the intro page
├── page1.mdx
├── page2.mdx
└── page3.mdx
```

<Callout type="info">
  There is no limit to number of pages, so write as much you want
</Callout>

### Add Content to `.MDX` files

Add content Using React components in Markdown using MDX.

```mdx

        Write anything to want using the MDX components
```

<Callout type="danger">
  Make sure to add a title and description to `.mdx files` either they won't
  work
</Callout>

### Update the links in `.config/sidebar.ts`

As the content is generated now the only remaining part is to show it

- Go to `.config/sidebar.ts`
- Add the links to Newly generated content

```mdx
...
 sidebarNav: [
    {
      title: "Getting Started",
      items: [
        {
          title: "Introduction",
          href: "/batch",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Learn",
      items: [
        {
          title: "Html",
          items: [
            {
              title: "basic",
              href: "/batch/learn/html/basic",
            },
             {
              title: "new page",
              href: "/batch/learn/html/new-page",
            },
          ],
        },
       ...
      ],
    },
   ...
```

- Links without `topic name` go to `index.mdx` in that folder
- `batch/learn` reffer to `.content/batch/learn/index.mdx`
- `batch/learn/html/topic-name` reffers to `.content/batch/learn/html/topic-name.mdx`
